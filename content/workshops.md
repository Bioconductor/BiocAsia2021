## Workshops

### Invited Mandarin Workshops (by 孙建强 Jianqiang Sun)

#### Introduction to image recognition with deep learning

卷积神经网络（Convolutional neural network; CNN）是用于图像识别的深度神经网络架构之一。 使用传统的机器学习方法来识别图像中的物体需要手动指定物体的特征，如颜色、大小、长宽比等。 相比之下，CNN 可以通过学习大量的图像，自动提取该特征。 因此，使用 CNN 建立一个图像识别模型，只需要收集大量的图像，而无需开发新的算法来提取特征。 如今，这种简单易行的方法在许多研究领域备受欢迎。在本次研讨会上，我们将学习如何使用为 R 提供的 torch 软件包来构建 CNN 模型进行图像识别。

Convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the deep neural network architectures used for image recognition. In contrast to the traditional machine learning methods that require humans to manually specify the features of objects such as color, size, aspect ratio, and so on, CNNs can automatically extract that feature by learning a large number of images.  Thus, building an image recognition model using CNN requires only collecting a large number of images without developing new algorithms to extract features. Today, this simple and easy method is popular in many research areas. In this workshop, we will learn how to use an R package named torch to build CNN models for image recognition.

#### Prediction of CRISPR guide RNA activity with deep learning

深度学习在计算机视觉以及自然言语处理等诸多领域取得重大成果，其技术现已被应用在包括生命科学在内的其它领域。深度学习主要通过构建深度神经网络来解决传统机器学习算法难以解决的问题。在诸多种深度学习的网络结构中，卷积神经网络（Convolutional neural network; CNN）以及循环神经网络（Recurrent neural network; RNN）最为人们熟知。其中，卷积神经网络在目标识别及目标检测等计算机视觉领域表现出色；循环神经网络则是在时间序列数据处理以及自然言语处理方面表现出色。在本次研习会上，我们考虑到众多 Bioconductor 用户熟悉于基因组序列分析，因此我们将讲解循环神经网络的基本算法以及如何使用 R 构建循环神经网络的方法。

Deep learning has proven to be one of the state-of-the-art tools in object recognition and natural language processing, and has been applied to many fields. Deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers of neural networks which is one of the traditional machine learning algorithms. Deep neural networks can solve problems that are difficult to solve with conventional machine learning algorithms. At present, various architectures of deep neural networks have been published, especially convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) are well known. The former is known to be excellent in computer visions such as object recognition and object detection, while the latter, RNN, is known to be excellent in time-series data analysis and natural language processing. Considering many Bioconductor users are familiar with genome sequence analysis, in this workshop, we will focus on RNN, and introduce the fundamental algorithm of RNN and procedures to build RNN models using R.
