### (time) Luke C. Gandolfo: "Untangling batch and biological effects with RLE plots"

Data visualisation is an essential part of analysing high-dimensional gene expression data, e.g. RNA-seq. One reason for such visualisation is to detect the presence of technical variation, e.g. batch effects, and to check the success of our attempts to remove such variation via normalisation.
However, in situations where the biological conditions of interest are significantly confounded with the factors producing technical variation, common visualisation approaches, e.g. PCA plots, can be poor tools, since such plots are sensitive to both technical and biological effects.
Relative log expression (RLE) plots, on the other hand, are sensitive to technical effects but insensitive, i.e. highly robust, to biological effects, making them an ideal tool for visualising the presence of technical variation in situations involving confounding.
RLE plots also have significant advantages over similar robust plots, e.g. boxplots.
These claims are demonstrated through the use of real data examples and statistical simulation.
