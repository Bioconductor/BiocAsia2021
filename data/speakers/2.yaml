text: "Belinda Phipson is a senior researcher at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. Together with Jovana Maksimovic, they have long maintained missMethyl, a Bioconductor package for analyzing Illumina HumanMethylation BeadChip data. They have also contributed a Bioconductor methylation workflow package that uses many methylation specific Bioconductor packages, including missMethyl https://doi.org/doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.methylationArrayAnalysis . Recently, they published a paper benchmarking gene set testing methods for methylation array data, with new methods implemented in missMethyl https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-021-02388-x ."
