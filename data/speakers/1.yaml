text: "Hiroshi Tsugawa got his PhD from Osaka University in 2012, Japan. His major is systems biology through computational mass spectrometry (CompMS) to deepen the understanding of metabolisms in living organisms. Employing CompMS, he could develop a data processing pipeline for complex MS data and identify unknown metabolites using computational analysis of mass fragmentation. The awards he received are RIKEN BAIHO Award (2020), Top 40 Under 40 of “The Analytical Science” (2018), and RIKEN Incentive Research Award (2016). Since 2021, he is working as an associate professor at the Department of Biotechnology and Life Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology."
